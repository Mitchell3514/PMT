## Issues
### Making a new issue
- Keep the title short and to the point.
- In the description, detail the following points:
  - The current situation.
  - Why is a change necessary.
  - How/what should it be changed. If it's still open for discussion, you can also put that down.
- Add any applicable tags.

### Issue discussions
- Discussions should at all times be civil.
- Try to stick to one message at a time, so combine responses to multiple people.
- Use English when not communicating anything language-specific (think translations).

### Claiming an issue
- If an issue is not yet assigned; assign yourself or asked to be assigned.  
For an already assigned issue, ask any assignee if/how you can help.
- Create a feature branch to resolve the issue.

## Pull Requests

### Making a PR
- Relate your title to the issue's title. (if applicable)
- The description should have a quick summary of the PR's intent and a more elaborate list of changes.
- Add any applicable tags.

### Requesting approval
- Thorougly check your changes for any mistakes and also test so on a self-hosted version.
- Any PR to development/master can only be reviewed and merged by a code author, so request approval by one in the comments (currently only me, [@Mitchell3514][github-Mitchell3514])

## Commits
- Commit messages should follow the standard by [Angular][angular-contributing].
- Where scope can be any file.
- A body and footer are not necessary, but if used, also follow the standard.
